### Lab 0

#### Example1
A simple example to understand the use of boolean operators. In this example, two idependent random source are used that generates 0 and 1. The output of the sources are used as inputs in an XOR operator.

#### Example2
Example2 focuses on adding tags in curves. 

#### Example3
Example3 combines two cosine waveforms of different frequencies and plots their frequency and time responses. 

#### Example4
Example4 plots the histogram of a uniform random variable. 

#### Example5
Example5 demonstrates how to add a delay to a signal. 

#### Example6
Example6 demonstrates the use and implementation of bandpass filter (BPF) in gnuradio. 

#### Example7
Example7 demonstrates the implementation and use of the downsampler in gnuradio.

#### Example8
Example8 demonstrates the implementation and use of the high pass filter (HPF) in gnuradio.

#### Example9
Example9 demonstrates the implementation and use of the low pass filter (LPF) in gnuradio.

#### Example10
Example10 demonstrates the use of the "Message Debug" operator in gnuradio.

#### Example11
Example11 demonstrates the use of the "selector" operator in gnuradio.

#### Example12
Example12 demonstrates the implementation of colored noise in gnuradio.

#### Example13
Example13 demonstrates the implementation of a down-converter in gnuradio.

### Lab1

#### Example1
Example1 demonstrates the use of QT GUI Sink.

#### Example2
Example2 demonstrates the implementaion of a waveform chooser in gnuradio.

#### Example3
Example3 demonstrates the use of the QT time and frequency sink in gnuradio.

#### Example4
Example4 simulates an AWGN channel.

#### Example5
Example5 demonstrates the use and functionalities of the Interpolating FIR filter in gnuradio.

#### Example6
Example6 demonstrates the use of the low pass filter (LPF) in gnuradio.

#### Example7
Example7 demonstrates how the choise of sampling frequency can influence the quality of the received signal in gnuradio.

#### Example8
Example8 demonstrates the functionalities of the rational resampler in gnuradio.

#### Example9
Example9 demonstrates how to measure the power of a received signal in gnuradio.

#### Example10
Example10 demonstrates how to measure the average power of a received signal in gnuradio.
