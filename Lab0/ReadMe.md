# Objectives
1. To understand and familiarize with the basic functionalities of gnuradio.
2. To create simple examples and simulate low complexity communications systems.

# Contents

## Example1
A simple example to understand the use of boolean operators. In this example, two idependent random source are used that generates 0 and 1. The output of the sources are used as inputs in an XOR operator.

## Example2
Example2 focuses on adding tags in curves. 

## Example3
Example3 combines two cosine waveforms of different frequencies and plots their frequency and time responses. 

## Example4
Example4 plots the histogram of a uniform random variable. 

## Example5
Example5 demonstrates how to add a delay to a signal.
