# Objectives
1. To understand and familiarize with the basic functionalities of gnuradio.
2. To create simple examples and simulate low complexity communications systems.

# Contents

## Example1
A simple example to understand the use of boolean operators. In this example, two idependent random source are used that generates 0 and 1. The output of the sources are used as inputs in an XOR operator.

## Example2
Example2 focuses on adding tags in curves. 

## Example3
Example3 combines two cosine waveforms of different frequencies and plots their frequency and time responses. 

## Example4
Example4 plots the histogram of a uniform random variable. 

## Example5
Example5 demonstrates how to add a delay to a signal. 

## Example6
Example6 demonstrates the use and implementation of bandpass filter (BPF) in gnuradio. 

## Example7
Example7 demonstrates the implementation and use of the downsampler in gnuradio.

## Example8
Example8 demonstrates the implementation and use of the high pass filter (HPF) in gnuradio.

## Example9
Example9 demonstrates the implementation and use of the low pass filter (LPF) in gnuradio.
